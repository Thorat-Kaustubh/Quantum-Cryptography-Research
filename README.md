# 🔐 Quantum Cryptography: Principles, Protocols, and Applications

> A comprehensive research paper exploring the foundations and future of secure communication using the principles of quantum mechanics.

---

## 📘 Overview

This repository contains my research paper **"Quantum Cryptography: Principles, Protocols, and Applications"**, which provides an in-depth analysis of the current state, implementation strategies, and real-world applications of **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)** systems.

The research highlights how **quantum mechanics**—particularly *superposition*, *entanglement*, and the *no-cloning theorem*—form the foundation of next-generation cryptographic systems.
